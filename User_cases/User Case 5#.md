 As a logged in user I want to be able to change my profile in order to update it. 

The user is able to change their profile information at any time if they ever feel like updating anything. The user is able to change their location at any given time by typing it in the search bar, and this will update the top restaurants that corresponds to their city. This makes it easy to for users to quickly find out top rated restaurants and nutritional values in the area or even search for restaurants in other cities.
