 As a logged in user I want to be able to change my profile in order to update it (changing location, preferred food type, etc.). 

The user is able to change their profile information at any time if they ever feel like updating anything. We will offer a settings page where they are able to change their preferences and we will also allow them to set their location based on where they are or where they are going to.
