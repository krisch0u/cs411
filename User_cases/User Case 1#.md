As a logged in user I want to select my location in order to find restaurants nearby.

Once the user has created an account, the user should be able to enter their location/city anywhere in the world. 
Once their location is set, the user will be presented with the top 5 rated restaurants in that city along with the serving size and calories of a 
basic dish at the restaurant. There will also be pictures of the restaurant to allow users to visualize the food at the restaurant
