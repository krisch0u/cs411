As a logged in user I want to select my location range in order to find restaurants nearby.

Once the user has created an account, the user should be able to select their location/city anywhere in the would. 
Once their location is set, the user will be presented with the top 5 rated restaurants in the city along with the serving size and calories of basic dishes at the restaurant. There will also be pictures of the restaurant to allow users to visualize the food at the restaurant
