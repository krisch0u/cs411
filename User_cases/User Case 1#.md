As a logged in user I want to select my location range in order to find people nearby.

Once the user has created an account, the user should be able to select their location/city within the continental United States. 
Once their location is set, the range of distance to view other profiles should be set as well. We will offer the preferred ranges 
on 5 mile increments, with the minimum distance of 1 mile, then 5 miles, to the maximum distance of 100 miles. After these options 
have been chosen by the logged in user, they will be able to find people through the profiles that are shown in the given radius.
