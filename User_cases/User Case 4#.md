 As a logged in user I want to be able to message my matches in order to plan a date at a restaurant/bar.

If a user and another user show mutual interest, by both swiping right on each other, they are able to message each other. We will suggest restaurants and bars based on their food interests and location, but it is up to the two users to agree on a restaurant or bar.
