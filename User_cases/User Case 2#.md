As a logged in user I want to select my food interest in order to find people who match me.

After the user creates a profile, the user should be able to choose their food interests from a list of available food options to choose from. Once their interests are set, other profiles are filtered so that profiles with more similar interests are shown first, followed by those with less similar interests.
As a reach, add allergies and dislikes.
