As a logged in user I want to swipe (left for no, right for yes) in order to express disinterest/interest in a person.

Once the user finishes creating a profile and selecting food interests, the user is able to view other users’ profiles where the user is able to either swipe right to show interest in a person or swipe left to show disinterest. The other user’s profile will show their food interests as well as a basic bio about themselves.
